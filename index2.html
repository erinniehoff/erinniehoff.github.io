<div class="article">
    <p class="groove"><p>&emsp;&ensp;I have I variety of interests. I love cooking, baking, and eating. You can learn more about this passion of mine <A HREF="index3.html"> here </A>. I also love learning about and spending time with animals. Some of my favorite animals are koalas, shetland ponies, penguins, and the jackalope. Recently, I have become interested in adventure sports. I took a hang gliding tour of Rio de Janeiro, which was incredible. Unfortunately, during that excursion I was attacked by a large bird, which is the reason I must now wear an eyepatch. In the rest of my spare time, I dabble in bongo playing, competitive swimming, and modern dance. Occasionally I take my dune buggy out on the beach or sell some of my vintage sports trading cards. <p>Image from http://new-cryptozoology.wikia.com/wiki/Jackalope.</p>
