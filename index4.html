    <ul>
    <li> Though I am currently studying sociology, which interests me greatly, my ambition is to open a glass blowing operation in New Mexico. I have always loved the arts, and feel that is truly where I belong. I will live off the land and create beautiful glass ornaments, tableware, and sculptures. </li>
    <li> I also hope to start a rescue for injured and homeless cockatiels, a bird that does not receive enough respect from the world at large.</li>
    <li> My final great dream is to open a corn maze.</li> </ul>
